# online-eCommerce-Banking-Application-

This web application is developed using Java Servlets, JDBC, and MySQL. The project's objective was to create a prototype banking application.
The application allows customers to register with the bank by providing a username and password, with a double-check mechanism to ensure consistent spelling. After registration, customers can log in securely. Upon successful login, they are directed to the "Banking Home" page, where they can specify an amount and choose to either deposit or withdraw funds. Each customer's account is uniquely identified using a username, account number, or custom identifier. Importantly, the application enforces a constraint to prevent account balances from going below zero, ensuring proper account management.

This project showcases the use of Java Servlets for handling HTTP requests and responses, JDBC for interacting with a MySQL database to store and retrieve customer account information, and front-end web development techniques.
